This is actually primarily the Chapter 2* project of book ASP.Net Core Razor Pages by Robert E. Beasley

It's main objective was to get familiar with creating a Web App solution, adding a razor page and model,
become familiar with the template, adding folders and classes, and to install/uninstall NuGet packages.
